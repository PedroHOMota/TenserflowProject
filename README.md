# Digit Recognitizion with neural network
This is my project for the module [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html)
<br />
The project overview goes as follow:
<br />
```In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image```

## Requirements
1. [Python 3](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/install.html)
2. [Keras](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/11/14/installing-keras-with-tensorflow-backend/)
3. [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/install.html)
4. [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) 

## How to clone
1. Get the github clone url
2. Use the following command to clone
```bash
$ git clone "url"
```

## How to Run
1. Execute the following command*
```bash
$ python main.py 
```
2. The ip and port used by the webapp will be shown on command prompt window
3. Access the ip on a browser

*The file keras-mnist.h5 has o be present on the same folder as the others scripts, otherwise  it won't run. The file can be clonned with this repo or generated running the NeuralNetworkTraining.py script.
